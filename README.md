"A new Flutter project."

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

For an app featuring Gemini AI's image description and question answering capabilities, here's a condensed roadmap:

1. **Setup Flutter Project**: Begin by setting up a new Flutter project in your preferred IDE.

2. **Integrate Gemini AI SDK**: Incorporate Gemini AI's SDK into your Flutter project. If no official SDK exists, utilize HTTP requests to interact with Gemini AI's APIs directly.

3. **Implement Image Description**: Design UI components allowing users to upload or capture images. Utilize Gemini AI to generate concise descriptions of uploaded images.

4. **Question Answering**: Create UI elements enabling users to input questions related to the displayed images. Utilize Gemini AI's question answering capabilities to provide accurate responses.

5. **Testing**: Thoroughly test the app to ensure smooth functionality and accurate responses for both image descriptions and question answering.

6. **Deployment**: Deploy the app to relevant platforms such as iOS, Android, or the web.

7. **Maintenance**: Regularly update the app to incorporate enhancements, address bugs, and adapt to any changes in Gemini AI's APIs.
